Inside the articles folder find the category folder where you want to add your article.\n\n\n\nGithub articles folder\n\n\nAfter choosing a folder suitable for your article, you can add a .qmd file directly in GitHub. A .qmd file is automatically formatted and added to the hosted website, they are also sorted by category and inserted into the websites search function.\n\n\n\nAdding a file in GitHub. You can either create a new file or import a pre-made .qmd file.\n\n\nTo add a .qmd file simply add .qmd in the file name when finalizing your file (Red box in the image below). When adding content be sure to integrate required metadata from the following code block:\n---\ntitle: \"Example title (This is the title you want the reader to see and \"interact\" with)\"\ncategories: [example category] ## Current categories are: Beginning a project, During a project, Ending a project, General (Categories are case sensitive)\ndate: \"9.25.2024\" ## date and time format is MM.DD.YYYY\nauthor: Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname ## Author/authors of the article. \ndate-modified: last-modified ## This adds an automatic last modified field to the article, last-modified function will automatically add the correct date when a modification is made to the article.\n---\nThe wiki supports full markdown and lets you have total control over the content of your article. We recommend using a simple markdown editor such as StackEdit (You can also read our article on the basics of StackEdit here).\nThe orange area in the image shown below is your “article” section. This section has to include the metadata at the top of the section for the article (Otherwise your article WILL NOT be indexed and won’t be rendered to the wiki)! After you have included the metadata section, you are free to write and format whatever you wish in the main article.\n\n\n\nEditing a file. RED section is your .qmd files name. YELLOW section is the main article section.\n\n\nWhen you feel like your article is ready to publish, simply press the green “Commit Changes” button in github. feel free to select the “push changes to main” button. Be sure to add a short description about your article into the commit comment in GitHub. Your article will be pushed to the wiki automatically. it might take a minute or two for your article to show up correctly.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
