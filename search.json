Taiga also offers the ability to self host a taiga instance on your own machines, we use taiga to manage the projects students are working on in Koodariverstas.\nWe recommend that you get to know the platform and its layout when you begin working in your first project.\n\n\n\nTaiga has multiple ways of logging-in, we recommend using the same GitHub account you use in your projects in Koodariverstas. This makes it easy to attribute changes and credit directly to you when the names on both platforms are identical.\nYou can sign in with GitHub directly through the login prompt.\n\n\n\nTaiga.io Login window\n\n\nAfter logging in you can head to the account settings and change your profile picture, name, and password. You can also directly download your account information or fully delete your account from the account settings.\nWhen entering names please use your real legal names so that we know who is who when attributing work and credits.\n\n\n\nWhen you login you are thrown directly into the “projects” view. This view will show you the projects you have created or collaborate on. You can view and manage all your projects from this view.\nThe project view lets you quickly see the issues you are working on and the tasks you are following that are being assigned to others.\n\n\n\nThis is your project view.\n\n\nThis page will help you understand the current to-do on a glance. You can follow others issues and coordinate your work with others and their timelines. If you don’t currently have any projects when logging in, this page will let guide you through creating a new project or joining a existing project.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen clicking on a project you will find a page that looks like this. Here you can see the team assigned to the project, action history, scrum and kanban, project wiki and current Issues.\n\n\n\nScrum is a standard way to follow and plan development processes.\nTaiga has a fully functional scrum management system that lets you follow tasks and check assigned workflows.\nHere you can see which tasks are allocated to you or other members in your team. You can also track the progress of all tasks here.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent tasks require different amounts of work and resources. Scrum let’s us assign the correct resources per task and track their progress in real time.\nThis also helps developers stay focused on their own work, and eases the workload of big projects by cutting it to bite sized bits.\n\nTL;DR: Scrum makes it easy to follow smaller tasks and assign resources to said tasks. Enabling developers to focus on their own tasks.\n\n\n\n\nKanban works in the same manner as scrum, the difference being that kanban focuses on the “bigger picture”. Where scrum concentrates on tasks as a part of a bigger picture, kanban focuses more on user stories. User stories are bigger sized entities that consist of the smaller scrum tasks.\nYou can think of it as a poster, where different parts of the whole poster consists of smaller parts of the poster to make a complete comprehensive poster.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the kanban view. Each user story consists of tasks that are managed in Scrum. When work is started on a task that is a part of a story, the story is updated to reflect the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere for example, i have “started working” on a task in user story 1. I have been assigned to the development to tasks for story 1. To reflect this change i have updated the kanban view to reflect the current state of the entire story.\n\nTL;DR: Kanban enables the following of the bigger picture of the project. This helps in planning for bigger features and keeping track of the entire project.\n\n\n\n\nTaiga has also a built in issues system. We use this to track known issues such as bugs, problems, requests or additional requirements. You can see all the current issues on the projects issues page.\nThe issues page shows you the Type, Severity and priority of the issue listed. You can also see the status, when the issue was posted and who it’s assigned to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the issues page, you can search issues by subject or reference. Here you can also add new issues and see the overall state of issues in the current project.\nWhen you click on an issue, it will open the detailed issue page.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the detailed issue page. Here you can see the description of the issue including the status, assigned personnel, possible attachments and comments made by other people in the project.\nUsage of issues helps everyone keep track of the problems that may occur during development.\n\nThis article is currently under construction.

    "text": "This article will teach you how to add pages and edit existing pages in our Wiki. This might be useful when you want to document your findings or want to add a component you made to the library of components that everyone can freely use.\n\n\nOn the bottom of every page, you will find the “Edit this page” and “Report an issue” buttons. Edit this page lets you edit the current page you are on and Report an issue lets you report any issues you might come across. If you are a student “Edit this page” will notify you about the requirement of forking your own branch for modifications. Reporting an issue opens up a new GitHub issue for the team to see.\n\n\n\nEdit this page and Report an issue buttons. These buttons are located at the bottom of every page\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen adding a new page to the wiki, head to the GitHub repository (Link located at the top right of the page).\n\n\n\nGithub link location\n\n\nInside the GitHub repository find the “articles” folder. Inside the articles folder find the category folder where you want to add your article. If you want to edit an article instead, simply head to the article you want to edit, and edit the .qmd file of the article.\n\nNote: Please refrain from modifying articles written by other people. If you still think that an article requires modifications, please ask the user in the articles “author” section for permission to modify their work, if you make changes, add yourself to the authors list of the article. You can find other users in the repository user list.\n\n\n\n\nGithub articles folder\n\n\nAfter choosing a folder suitable for your article, you can add a .qmd file directly in GitHub. A .qmd file is automatically formatted and added to the hosted website, they are also sorted by category and inserted into the websites search function.\n\nNote: Quarto MarkDown (.qmd) and regular MarkDown (.md) are different file formats. If you have imported a file from a markdown editor, please make sure to change the file to .qmd before adding it to the wiki.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a file in GitHub. You can either create a new file or import a pre-made .qmd file.\n\n\nTo add a .qmd file simply add .qmd in the file name when finalizing your file (Red box in the image below). When adding content be sure to integrate required metadata from the following code block:\n---\ntitle: \"Example title (This is the title you want the reader to see and \"interact\" with)\"\ncategories: [example category] ## Current categories are: Beginning a project, During a project, Ending a project, General (Categories are case sensitive)\ndate: \"9.25.2024\" ## date and time format is MM.DD.YYYY\nauthor: Firstname Lastname, Firstname Lastname ## Author/authors of the article. \ndate-modified: last-modified ## This adds an automatic last modified field to the article, last-modified function will automatically add the correct date when a modification is made to the article.\n---\nThe wiki supports full markdown and lets you have total control over the content of your article. We recommend using a simple markdown editor such as StackEdit (You can also read our article on the basics of StackEdit here).\nThe orange area in the image shown below is your “article” section. This section has to include the metadata at the top of the section for the article (Otherwise your article WILL NOT be indexed and won’t be rendered to the wiki)! After you have included the metadata section, you are free to write and format whatever you wish in the main article.\n\nNote: You are responsible for the content you write in your article. It is your responsibility to fact check and reference others work correctly. All articles are moderated and checked for disruptive content before they are published in the wiki.\n\n\n\n\nEditing a file. RED section is your .qmd files name. YELLOW section is the main article section.\n\n\nWhen you feel like your article is ready to publish, simply press the green “Commit Changes” button in github.\nIf you are a part of Koodariverstas staff, you have the permissions to directly push changes to main.\n\nNote: When a staff member is pushing their changes GitHub will give you the option to bypass the rules and push directly to main.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a student working in a project and want to edit or publish an article, you need to create your own branch for the changes you have made. Your branch will be sent automatically for review when you push your changes. When your changes are approved by an administrator your changes will be automatically updated to the wiki and your branch will be deleted.\nThere are a few ways of managing your branches. Here are two options we recommend for everyone regardless of their technical knowledge and experience with GitHub.\n\n\nWhen adding directly through GitHub you will be prompted when committing to create a new branch for your changes.\n\n\n\nProposing a change in GitHub\n\n\nSelect the “create a new branch” option from the selection. This will make a new branch for your changes and send an automatic request for review for administrators.\n\nNote: You will not be able to commit directly to main as a student. Even if you get the option to commit to main, you will get an error message saying that your commit has been blocked.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can use the GitHub desktop app for creating a new branch. GitHub desktop lets you create and manage you branches directly in the app making it easy to keep track of your branches and changes.\n\n\n\nCreating a branch in GH desktop app\n\n\nGitHub desktop lets you manage your branches and the cloned repository with ease. These are the options we recommend you use when adding or editing content. There are other ways of managing your branches, but these are the ones we recommend for everyone.\nManaging branches directly through VS codes version control is also an option, but we have noticed that VS code has some trouble with sending requests directly to GitHub causing some pull requests to simply never show up to the administrators.\n\nNote: In both cases (Staff and Student) when your push is completed your article will be pushed to the wiki automatically. It will take a minute or two for your article to show up correctly on the web page.",
