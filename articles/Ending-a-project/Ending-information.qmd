# Filling in your ending information in EURA2021

When your participation in a project is coming to an end, you are required to fill out the ending information for the European Union. This information is used to track the overall success of Koodariverstas and it's impact on participants employment status.

> **Note:** If you need a refresher on how to log in to EURA, you can find it from our previous article [here.](https://xamkfi.github.io/Koodariverstas-wikiplatform/articles/Beginning-a-project/starting-information.html)

You an find the fields for entering your ending information when opening the project page in EURA.

> **Note:** EURA asks you to provide the ending information every time you participate in a project ran by koodariverstas. This is **not** necessary since you can edit your previously submitted information at a later date.

## Providing the correct information

There are different ways to provide your information depending on the circumstances of your participation.

1.  If this is your first and only time of participating in a project ran by koodariverstas

    -   Fill in your ending information like normal and add the date your participation ends.

2.  If you have previously participated and submitted the information already.

    -   You can go back to your original submission and edit the ending date to match the end of your latest project.

3.  You have 2 back-to-back projects with koodariverstas.

    -   In the case you know that you are participating in two different cases with different ending dates. Provide the ending date of the later project.

    > **Note:** The important part of submitting the information is to correctly mark the entire duration of your participation whether it's just for one short project or multiple longer ones. **You can always edit your ending information to reflect your current circumstances.**

## Information form

The image below shows you the form you need to fill.

This information consists of:

-   Ending date

-   Employment status when your participation ends

-   Did you finish your diploma or other relevant professional certificates thanks to your participation
