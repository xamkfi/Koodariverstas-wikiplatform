# Your guide to Taiga.io

![Taiga.io Logo](images/taigaLogo.png){fig-alt="Taiga.io Logo" fig-align="center" width="708"}

## What is Taiga.io?

[Taiga.io](https://taiga.io/) is our preferred project management tool. Taiga is fully **open-source** and has a generous & unlimited free tier. Taiga also offers the ability to self host a taiga instance on your own machines, we use taiga to manage the projects students are working on in Koodariverstas.

We recommend that you get to know the platform and its layout when you begin working in your first project.

## Account management

Taiga has multiple ways of logging-in, we recommend using the **same GitHub account** you use in your projects in Koodariverstas. This makes it easy to attribute changes and credit directly to you when the names on both platforms are identical.

You can sign in with **GitHub** directly through the login prompt.

![Taiga.io Login window](images/TaigaLogin.png){fig-align="center"}

After logging in you can head to the account settings and change your profile picture, name, and password. You can also directly download your account information or fully delete your account from the account settings.

When entering names **please use your real legal names** so that we know who is who when attributing work and credits.

## Projects

When you login you are thrown directly into the "projects" view. This view will show you the projects you have created or collaborate on. You can view and manage all your projects from this view.

The project view lets you quickly see the issues you are working on and the tasks you are following that are being assigned to others.

![This is your project view.](images/TaigaProjectsview.png){fig-align="center"}

This page will help you understand the current to-do on a glance. You can follow others issues and coordinate your work with others and their timelines. If you don't currently have any projects when logging in, this page will let guide you through creating a new project or joining a existing project.

![](images/Taiga%20img%201.png){fig-align="center"}

When clicking on a project you will find a page that looks like this. Here you can see the team assigned to the project, action history, scrum and kanban, project wiki and current Issues.

## Scrum

Scrum is a standard way to follow and plan development processes.

Taiga has a fully functional scrum management system that lets you follow tasks and check assigned workflows.

Here you can see which tasks are allocated to you or other members in your team. You can also track the progress of all tasks here.

![](images/Taiga%20scrum.png){fig-align="center"}

Different tasks require different amounts of work and resources. Scrum let's us assign the correct resources per task and track their progress in real time.

This also helps developers stay focused on their own work, and eases the workload of big projects by cutting it to bite sized bits.

> **TL;DR:** Scrum makes it easy to follow smaller tasks and assign resources to said tasks. Enabling developers to focus on their own tasks.

## Kanban

Kanban works in the same manner as scrum, the difference being that kanban focuses on the "bigger picture". Where scrum concentrates on tasks as a part of a bigger picture, kanban focuses more on user stories. User stories are bigger sized entities that consist of the smaller scrum tasks.

You can think of it as a poster, where different parts of the whole poster consists of smaller parts of the poster to make a complete comprehensive poster.

![](images/Taiga%20kanban.png){fig-align="center"}

This is the kanban view. Each user story consists of tasks that are managed in Scrum. When work is started on a task that is a part of a story, the story is updated to reflect the changes.

![](images/Taiga%20kanban2.png){fig-align="center"}

Here for example, I have "started working" on a task in user story 1. I have been assigned to the development to tasks for story 1. To reflect this change I have updated the kanban view to reflect the current state of the entire story.

> **TL;DR:** Kanban enables the following of the bigger picture of the project. This helps in planning for bigger features and keeping track of the entire project.

## Issues

Taiga has also a built in issues system. We use this to track known issues such as bugs, problems, requests or additional requirements. You can see all the current issues on the projects issues page.

The issues page shows you the Type, Severity and priority of the issue listed. You can also see the status, when the issue was posted and who it's assigned to.

![](images/Taiga%20issues.png){fig-align="center"}

This is the issues page, you can search issues by subject or reference. Here you can also add new issues and see the overall state of issues in the current project.

When you click on an issue, it will open the detailed issue page.

![](images/Taiga%20issue2.png){fig-align="center"}

This is the detailed issue page. Here you can see the description of the issue including the status, assigned personnel, possible attachments and comments made by other people in the project.

Usage of issues helps everyone keep track of the problems that may occur during development.

### General

***Purpose of the project and objective(s)***

This project was initiated because Company X adopted the ISO 9001 quality management system. As part of this system, customer feedback is an essential tool for improving service quality and maintaining customer loyalty and so on.....

This project aims to create a customer feedback form that is easy to find and seamless to fill out. The form will include questions designed to meet CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) metrics, while also providing space for open feedback. Additionally, customers will have the option to provide their contact information, along with their preferred time and method for personal follow-up ...and so on

### Terminology

| Term | Explanation |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| CSAT | Customer satisfaction score. It is a commonly used metric that indicates how satisfied customers are with a company’s products or services. |
| It’s measured through customer feedback and expressed as a percentage (best 100% to worst 0%). |  |

### Project scope

The project scope is:

-   Design and development of the feedback form.
-   Testing and validation to ensure all requirements.
-   Implementation of the form on the company’s website or other relevant platforms.
-   Written instructions how to use, manage and maintain the feedback form.

Out of the scope are:

-   Developing any other customer service feedback tools (such as reporting for the form, CRM integration, chat boxes, etc.).
-   Maintaining or redesigning Company's web page
-   This means that the Company is responsible to add the link to the web page or other relevant places
