## Guide on joining the XAMK GitHub organization

Koodariverstas is a part of Xamk and as a result, all code developed in Koodariverstas should be documented on our [GitHub](https://github.com/xamkfi).

Our GitHub is open to everyone and we encourage you to get to know the repositories/projects we are working on. Even this Wiki is fully hosted through GitHub pages and automated through GitHub actions. All of the source code is available at our [repository](https://github.com/xamkfi/Koodariverstas-wikiplatform).

Your first step is to create your own GitHub account [here](https://github.com/).

When you have created your GitHub account, you can request access to the GitHub organization through [Xinfo](https://xinfo.xamk.fi/customerui).

> **Please note:** only **one** member of a team needs to send a request to Xinfo **(Read inviting others into a repository from below).**

![This is the main page of Xinfo. You want to leave an ICT service request for access to GitHub](images/Github%20tut1.png)

When sending a request to access the organization, **please attach your exact GitHub username to the ticket**.

![Fill your information here. Be sure to add a description where you clearly state requesting access to GitHub](images/Github%20tut2.png)

When you gain access to the organization inside GitHub, you can create your own repositories and invite anyone to collaborate on your own repository. **One member inside the organization can directly invite others from outside the organization to collaborate on repositories they own.**

We hope this helps you begin development in Koodariverstas.

*Happy Coding!*
