# Adding and Editing pages

If you want to add a new page to the wiki, head to the GitHub repository (Link located at the top right of the page).

Inside the GitHub repository find the "articles" folder. Inside the articles folder find the category folder where you want to add your article.

After choosing a folder suitable for your article, you can add a .qmd file directly in GitHub. A .qmd file is automatically formatted and added to the hosted website, they are also sorted by category and inserted into the websites search function.

To add a .qmd file simply add .qmd in the file name when finalizing your file (Red box in the image below). When adding content be sure to integrated metadata from the following code block:

``` {#metadata .HTML}

title: "Example title (This is the title you want the reader to see and "interact" with)"
categories: [example_category]
date: "25.9.2024" ## date and time format is MM.DD.YYY

```

The wiki supports full markdown and lets you have total control over the content of your article. We recommend using a simple markdown editor such as [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/).
