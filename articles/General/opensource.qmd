# Basics of Open-Source projects

![](images/Open_Source_Initiative.png){fig-align="center" width="410"}

We believe in the importance of open-source software in the future of software development. Open-source projects give everyone a chance to get involved in software development regardless of their social status or country of origin. A typical open-source project consists of three major pillars. We will dive deeper into the depths of open-source in this article. There are also

## Pillars of open-source

1.   **Access to all:** By their very nature, open-source projects are always publicly available to see for everyone interested. For a project to be considered an open-source project the majority of its code and resources are to be made publicly available for everyone to see and study.

2.  **Communities:** Open-source projects live and die by their communities. Many open-source communities consist of people from every walk of life and every country on the planet. For example: some projects might be managed by industry professionals, and developed in co-operation with hobbyist programmers from around the world.

3.  **Licenses and agreements:** Open-source projects use generous licenses with a few key restrictions to make sure that the derivative works are also kept open to everyone. The most common open-source licenses are GPL and Apache 2. These two licenses give everyone the right to do whatever they want with the software developed in the community. Both of these licenses emphasize that any derivative work retains its open nature, but their direct approach differs quite a bit.
